# PYTHON_FINAL_PROJECT

## Data
The aim of this analysis is to examine how the transition to low-carbon sources of electricity generation may affect the growth of GDP per capita. For doing the datasets are being retrieving using webscrabbing techniques from Our World in Data and ISO repositories, guaranting to have the more updated version of the files ( data on energy consumption and list of countries).

## Coding

To process this project five modules were created:

    1. loading
    2. creating_table
    3. analyzing
    4. modeling
    5. validating
